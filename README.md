Hi, I‚Äôm Xaviour.

A full stack software engineer specialising in web development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. The current crowning feat of my career is the cloud-based Organelle digital health platform (cyber-secure health data analysis and eCommerce user/practitioner web-app), which I architected, developed, and delivered over an eighteen month period as the head of a 12 man team.

I was hired to the project as a contracted software engineer, was then instantly promoted to team lead, then upon successful delivery of the MVP I was again raised to first CSM then CEO. From developing microservices to managing stakeholders, architecting databases and leading interdisciplinary teams, the sheer diversity of experience it afforded me puts me far ahead of my peers and makes me a perfect hire for any company looking for more than just another code monkey.

I have years of commercial experience in Typescript, React, NodeJS, AWS, JS, CSS, HTML and Python, as well as a strong personal project and university driven familiarity with Rust, Golang, Java, C, and .NET. I have a proven history of delivering, innovating, and excelling. My proactive nature and boundless curiosity means I‚Äôm always looking for a new challenge to develop my skills.
